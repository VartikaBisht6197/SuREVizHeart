## 🔬 What is SuRE?

SuRE (Survey of Regulatory Elements) is a high-throughput assay used to study gene regulation. It maps allele-specific expression back to the genome, allowing researchers to assess changes in regulatory activity upon the introduction of SNPs and InDels. The current SuREVizHeart application showcases data from heart-related studies, including six complex plasmid libraries representing 4.7 million variants.  

### 🧬 What are raQTLs?  
**Reporter Assay Quantitative Trait Loci (raQTLs)** are variants showing significant differences in expression between reference and alternate alleles, highlighting the regulatory impact of variants. Refer to [High-throughput identification of human SNPs affecting regulatory element activity](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0455-2) for a detailed explanation.
